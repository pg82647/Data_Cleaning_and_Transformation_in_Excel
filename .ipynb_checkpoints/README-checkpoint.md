## DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION

•	Removed blank cells from the sheet.  
•	Made column names bold in order to make it look different from other row entries.  
•	Formatted the sheet as table without removing the filter arrows which will enable me sort data later on.  
•	Added the dollar sign to the sales data.  
•	Sorted data based on sales column values from largest to smallest.  
•	Conditional formatting on the Total Sales column was applied using TOP/BOTTOM rules with top 10 percent highlighted in green and the Bottom 10 percent highlighted in red.  
•	Filtered the Genre column for ‘Hardrock’ genre only.  
•	Substituted “Ac/Dc” with “AC/DC” in the Artists column and hid the original column.  
•	3 duplicated rows were removed.  
•	There was no missing data in the dataset.  
•	My table, therefore, shows the top selling hard rock albums from 1956 to 2011.
